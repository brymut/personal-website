        <p>
          I am a software engineer with experience in full stack web
          development, primarily using Python, Javascript and associated web
          frameworks. With 3+ years experience in the field, I have been
          involved in bringing many web projects from first-draft wireframe
          designs to live production environments, serving thousands of users
          per day. Both on physical, networked hardware on virtualised
          environments using XEN/Chef/Docker and cloud-based deployments on
          GoogleCPlatform and Digital Ocean. Projects I have been a part of
          range from developing community centred projects in team environments
          (subcity.org / openstates.org), building applications in corporate
          contexts (sas.com/en_gb/company-information.html), to building
          assistive developer tools for myself and others to use
          (github.com/brymut/off-stack). In my spare time away from my keyboard,
          I enjoy run a weekly community radio show on subcity.org, skateboard
          and during term time, volunteer my time with Codeclub codeclub.org.uk,
          an after-school club where children build up programming skills.
